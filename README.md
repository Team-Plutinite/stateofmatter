## State of Matter

Common issues and fixes:

 - Git clone "filenames too long"
	 - 1. Open up powershell/cmd/git bash/whatever command line of your choice in whatever folder you want the repo in 
	 - 2. Run the command ```git clone https://github.com/JackKalina/stateofmatter.git -c core.longpaths=true```
		 - 2a. It'll probably prompt you to log into github. Do so 
	- 3. Once the clone is done open up GitHub Desktop (since we all seem to be using that) and do File -> Add local repository... and direct it to whatever folder you cloned into
